## Detailed Events
After surviving the night, the party decide to bring the children east towards
Korum. But by midday, it has become too hot for the party to continue. They
stop for a meal and a siesta.

Once the party is under way again, the spot sand being kicked up in the distance
to the east. As they approach the source, it turns out to be a caravan headed
to Rodhan from Korum.

Kona, Fallon and Taban go to talk with the caravaneers to see whence they came
and whither they go. The man, Fegan, tells them that that morning, the caravan
was set upon by a giant beast, killing one of their members and absconding with
several of their camels. According to the reports, the beast was as tall as
five men and had three heads.

Fallon suggests that the party and the caravan camp together for the night for
safety. They break bread with Fegan and his partner, Shea. Fallon sings the
children to sleep before Kona leads them in more risqu√© material.

The night passes uneventfully. In the morning, they share breakfast before
parting ways. The party continues to the east. Most of the party are wary of
encountering the beast, but Kona is excited to kill it.

Early in their walks, they come across a slightly off bloke, tattooed all
over and overly warm, Crond D'jab. He has been led across the plains by a
mysterious crackling voice on the edge of his perception. Mabyn, who had spotted
him across the land is not impressed. Kona chats his ear off as the party
continues.

Their route becomes rockier with each passing mile.
