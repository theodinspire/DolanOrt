Leaving the tower with four halfling children in tow, Annachaul (CREEPER),
Nootch, Tsiggan (Segaun), and Cynty, the group sets up camp outside the tower.
In the south we see the high ice mountains. Mabyn questions the children and
tells the group that Cynty says she is from a different tribe from the north of
this area. Cynty tells Mabyn that she arrived on camel to this fort some time
before the other children. Mabyn is concerned by the dark eyes on Annacaul,
but he seems to be in possession of his senses and she tucks the children in
with a bedtime story.

The group decides to rest for the night and take Cynty back to her tribe in the
morning. The first watch goes by uneventfully with Vlasaag and Taban-Bo. They
wake up Kona and Zeehing for the second shift. While Kona kills time with solo
sword drills, Annachaul and Cynty get up and tell her they need to go potty.
She escorts them to the latrine area and notices some lights in the distance.
She calls over Zeehing who follows the lights to investigate them. Zeehing
discovers that they are just magical dancing lights.

Kona goes to wake up Fallon and when she turns back, Annachaul and Cynty are
gone. Kona sees one set of footprints leading away from the camp. Fallon casts
some magical lights and follow the footprints. In the distance she see one child
struggling over the terrain. She gets on all fours and chases.

Fallon yells for the child to stop. He does. A loud voice from the north says
“I told you to keep going!” Fallon tries to convince the kid to go back to camp.
He freezes in indecision and told her that Cynty told him he’d be safe.

While Zeehing heads back to the camp and Kona wakes up the rest of the party.

Fallon uses her lights to illuminate a creepy woman with a big beak nose and
green skin. The woman attacks Fallon with psychic damage. While Kona charges at
the woman in a rage, a bunch of rats come out of the wall of the castle and
attack Mabyn. She sets them on fire as they bite the shit out of her. As the
rats keep attacking her, Taban very majestically cartwheels her away from the
rats.

Kona continues to attack the woman with her sword. Vlasaag and Zeehing fire
range weapons to help. Fallon calms Annachaul and leads him back towards camp.
Mabyn, now free of the rats and seeing the woman attempt to flee, casts Entangle
and traps the her in vines. Kona avoids the vines and continues to attack the
woman. The woman breaks free of the vines, but Vlasaag finally delivers the
killing crossbow bolt. Taban shakes off the remaining rats killing them all.

The woman was wearing a gold and silver bracelet (200gp) that Cynty was also
wearing.

We take a long rest. And sleep the fuck in.
