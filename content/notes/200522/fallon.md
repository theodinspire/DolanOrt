## Notes
Open with Goblins announcing that they've heard us.

Round 1:  
I ready a crossbow at the southwest door  
Kona fails at hitting the goblin at the northeast door  
Mabyn just botches with her shillelagh and is deafened for a turn  
Taban-bo opens the door. I shoot for 6 damage. Vlasaag misses. Taban-bo kills it
with a kunai. Goblin A dead.
Goblin B hits Kona for 6  
Zeehing sacred flames but misses  

2:  
I kick open the door and roll in and shoot down a goblin  
Kona swords the last remaining goblin  
Everyone gathers at the door  

3:  
I run down the stairs and cast shatter on them all. They all dead. Super dead.  
K, M, T and Z move downstairs  
This big goblin busts in the door and throws a javelin at Kona, missing  

4:  
I miss the goblin with my crossbow   
Kona misses the goblin.  
Mabyn hides behind the tapestry  
Taban-bo misses with both his sword and his fist. The latter of which is
deflected into Kona  
Goblin misses Kona  
Zeehing misses the goblin with sacred flame  

5:  
I miss the goblin with my crossbow.
Kona rages, all the present player characters are afeared of her. She hacks at
the goblin and hits for 8 damage
Mabyn flings fire at him and misses, because she's so afraid of Kona
Taban-bo assists Kona
The goblin swings with both swords, missing only with one, for two damage  
Zeehing misses with sacred flame.

6:  
I fail at viscous mockery  
Kona recklessly smashes the goblin with her sword for nine damage. We are no
longer frightened  
Mabyn throws fire at him for 4 damage. Goblin not too well  
Taban-bo hits with his dagger, slicing the goblin's brachial artery, fainting
him.  

We tie him up to bring him to justice

On goblins in the bottom chamber:
* 24 silver
* 6 frog skin purses
* 7 scimatars
* 5 short bows

In the goblin chief's chamber, once a store room:
* Small lockbox (blue light and silver Kona-light from inside), near his throne
of crates and kegs
  * 50 gold
  * 6 gems (each 10 gp)
  * 2 pink potions, evocation
  * Small (brooch sized) stylized tree, glowing silver. Quall's Feather Token
    * If outdoors, throw the token on the ground and an 60ft oak tree will
    appear. Token is spent. I know that there was a mage called Quall who
    created a bunch of these one shot tokens
* Greataxe
* Heavy Cross bow
  * 10 bolts
* Crowbar
* A whistle in the shape of a bird-not colored
* Bullseye Lantern (6 hours)

Same wolf crest is chiseled into the wall of this room.

Mabyn opens the crest on the wall.

Come down these stairs to a armor room. Locked stone door on the right,
collapsed corner to the left. Taban-bo tries to unlock it, but gets sliced by
a block that falls on me and him. I manage to dodge.

The next room holds a treasure trove. Piles of coins. Piles. Lots. Kona sees a
beautifully made sword, sitting on a stand.

I knock it off the stand with my dagger.

Round 1:
Some slurping, squishy noises happen.
