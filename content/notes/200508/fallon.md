## Adventure
Party heads to Annurati Fellowship, Bryn and Illian.

Kona wins an arm wrestle, we talk about the statuette. Give it to them, describe
what was ha

I: "We have had much to do here; there have been quite few of us at the castle."

We eat some flatbreads, lamb, herbed mead. Statue is put into a desk. He pulls
a bag from behind a tapestry.

Bag of coins (200gp).

Mabyn asks about the history of the Annurati Fellowship.

The statuette's history:
* The amber came from the West, past Rodhan, through where Annur came.
A dark forest, whose name is lost.
* (History 18) If the tree is old enough and from a magical source, it may imbue
the Amber with its own properties. And old trees can have old magics in them.
* Carved by one of Annur's retinue near the end of his reign.
* Annur is the subject of the work. Human.
* (History 19) The regional dragonborn were created for Annur's armies.
* Annur is an Alexander the Great type

We go to Farred's Tower. Alea answers. The Modrons invent the robot from my
Performance (27, nat 20). Farred is in! One of the Modrons serves us tea and
sugared cakes. He cannot fix it. Looking at the pages, the cult did not know
what they were doing. That they did it was an accident. The cult were playing
with the body, trying to adjust the body and to reach into the mind. They failed
at reaching into the mind. They changed some of the mind.

This can be done by magic users such as hisself, but it is a very powerful spell
and not cheap. Polymorph spells do end at some point. A *Wish* or *True
Polymorph* could fix it. We talk to him about Annachaul. He will need to
research the essence of Meenlocks and Merlings. "Fay Haggi" was on the notes
that we saw.

(Maybe ask Whitehall if I could pay off a person inside the Azure Lance to gimme
  the scoop on what's happening.)

The next day, I get a summons from Alin and Golbara. I meet them in a small,
semiformal room in their estate. I'm told that they've heard that we like to
help people. As a wedding gift, Alin's uncle gifted them some land in town
a couple days south, Garabash. Rumors of raiding happening there. Not enough to
call the guard in on, but the people are unhappy.

Head south.

Rations for a 10 days: 5 gold
2 days

Guards at the gate, scoff at their landlords, but accept us as help. Send us to
the Temple of the Silver Embrace. Not decrepit, but not a "nice" village.

The temple, the doors are like arms hugging each other. We walk in, through an
antechamber and a large sanctuary? Can hold half the town comfortably. Town is
about 200 people. Tapestries depicting the teachings of the silver embrace,
warm tones. Each tapestry is bound in silver thread, about taking care of your
family and those in need.

(Religion 21) When the Resplendent Embrace have services, the priest wanders
through the crowd and may speak points to a particular person, instead of just
from the pulpit. Can hear much from anywhere in the room.

Two men arguing at a table. They stop when we come in.

"What brings you to Garabash?" "We want to stop the raiders"

Not an important town in the trade routes. Mostly goats, things from goats.
Some of the goatherds say their goats are being taken. One says that he was
beset upon by goblins. Not large parties, three or four at a time. It seems
that the goblins coming from the south. May have taken up in the J.R.? tower.
Built two centuries ago by a warlord Haran, but is believed to be haunted.

How often do these goblins attack? Weekly, to take a number of goats.

We decide to camp out by some goats.

The shorties take first watch.

The goats bleat and there are goat Wranglers

FIGHT
Round 0:
Me: position lights over the wranglers, and ready an action for if they attack
V: Wakes and readys his bow
T: Wakes and tries to sneak
M: Moves forward and casts Shillelagh
K: Moves to me, rages and hurls a javelin at a goblin. Winds swirl around her
and then blast out, knocking the goats over
Z: Casts bless on me, Kona and Taban'bo
Goats: Trample me (3 damage) and some goblins
Goblin attacks, triggering my readied action and I cast *shatter* killing all
three

(13 Investigation) 7 silver per goblin, no markings.

(23 Int) Goblins don't carry identifying marks while raiding.

Take the goats with us. The head man, Fazzelik is still looking at the notes.
We bring in the goat corpses. Fazzelik is disappointed that we killed the goats.

We rest up for the night. Mabyn asks why its haunted. Tower built by a warlord,
Haran. Some orc raids killed many workers. A plague killed some more workers.
Once he moved in, a dragon Kashananan nested in the tower. Haran's wife was
distraught from the troubles and threw herself from the top of the tower.
People who go there tend not to come back.

We go to the tower. The doors are old and brittle. I botch kicking it in. Kona
kinda kicks it in. It was unbarred, we could've just opened it.

Vlasaag slices a centipede
Mabyn misses spider with fire
Zeehing misses with spider sacred flame
I sink a crossbow bolt into it
