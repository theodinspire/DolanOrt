Fagin, Shaya, two merchants headed to Rodhan
were set upon by a three-headed beast, bipedal.
It made off with three camels and killed one of their party

Kids lullabied to sleep.

Weapons in its hand. Five men tall.

Fagin and Shaya are apprehensive, but we assured them with setting watch.

First watch: I hear howling in the far distance.
Sleepy time, nothing exciting.

Meet up with Cron during the day. He's on a quest, also headed to Korum.
He joins our party for the day.

Come upon some rocky feature. Two paths, left and right. Right is rocky on top,
Left is rocky on the bottom. We take the right.

Fight the two headed beast and its puppers

Round 1:  
Taban'Bo: climbs the cliff, but doesn't get up.  
The giant: swings at him, and claps its weapons together. Taban'bo misses a
dagger toss in response.  
The wolf: tries to hit Kona but misses  
Me: I cast Phantasmal Force and a dire panther appears to the giant behind it.
The panther hits for 6 damage. (10)  
Cron: *Detect Magic* detects something on Taban'bo, here and there, not on enimies.  
Kona: Rages. Glowing, green-yellow plates form around her body. Attacks wolf  
Mabyn: *Entangle* but doesn't get, moved into view.

Round 2:  
Taban'bo: backs away?  
Giant: tries to get Kona  
Wolf: grapples Kona, but she breaks free  
2 Wolf: appears.  
Me: 2 damage from the panther (9). 7 from the *Shatter* to the Giant and the Wolf  
Cron: Casts *Expeditious Retreat*  
Kona: Swings at the first wolf, and does 6 damage to the wolf. Kills it.  
Mabyn: Misses the giant with her fire  

Round 3:  
Taban'bo: Just whiffs on his attack with his sword:  
Etten: Tries to hit the panther  
Wolf: Bites at Taban'bo, but misses  
Me: *Thunderwave*. It saves, takes 5 damage. Head panther does 2.  
Cron: *Burning Hands* at the Etten for 11 damage, hides behind rock.  
Kona: Hits Etten with a danger sword.  
Mabyn: Misses again with fire.  

Round 4:  
Taban'bo: Stabs wolf and karate chops it. 9 + 8 damage. Wolf dead.  
Etten: Investigates panther  
Me: Crossbows Etten  
Cron: *Firebolt* for 7 damage and hides again  
Kona: Crits with her sword and does 10 damage  
Mabyn: Throws fires at it for 1 damage  

Round 5:  
Taban'bo: Acrobatics into battle. Misses the giant with his word, but kicks him in the knee.  
Etten: tries to run away. Kona hits for 10 damage. Taban'bo hits for seven.

##### End of combat

Ambush spot. 15 silver.

Mabyn turns into a wolf and tracks the Etten. We hear some soft lowing. Three
camels. Nothing on them, tethered to low shrubbery. In the lean-to, some soft
bedding with gnawn bones. Bunch of blankets and rugs on the other side, slept in.
Body of lost merchant is not there. There is a chest, inside there are:

* 3 camels (40 gold each)
* 3 bottles
  * 2 pink (evocation, yellow) Rego Healing
  * 1 darker pink (evocation, yellow) Greater Healing
* 2 rolled up parchment
  * Illusion spell (gold) Disguise Self
  * Divination spell (purple) Locate Object
* 10 rugs (25 gold each).

We rest for the night at the lean-to. Nothing happens over night.

Another uneventful day and night and we find ourselves almost at Korum.

We find the matron and explain what has been happening with the cultists.

She offers to us four gems. (200 gold). I try to refuse, but she insists. She
gives me her blessing. (Divided up amongst all players for the arc)

Taban'bo asks about her dislike for the wizard, but she expresses that she
just dislikes wizards in general. That their magic comes from an evil place.

I offer to network her with some of my ties. After some small talk, she leads us
out.

Kona gives a rug to Jibyek.

Mabyn joins our party, after conferring with the matron that they're on the
right track for this solving thing.

260 exp each.
