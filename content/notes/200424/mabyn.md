After surviving the night, the party and the THREE remaining actual halfling children decide to go east to return towards THE CITY.

By midday it is too hot to continue. The group stops for a meal. They continue on and in the evening they see some dust being kicked up in the distance they are walking towards.

It is a caravan of folks with fully loaded camels headed to Rohan from Corum.

Kona and Fallon and Taban go to talk with them. The man, Fegan, tells them that their party that morning was accosted by a giant beast at least five men tall that had three heads and took some of their camels and killed one of their men.

Fallon suggests that the party and the caravan camp together for the night. The party meets his partner, Shea, and they set up camp. Fallon sings the kids a bedtime story before Kona breaks into the rauchy songs.

The night passes uneventfully. In the morning they share breakfast and then part ways. The party continues to head east. Most are wary of encountering this beast, Kona is excited to kill it.

Elsewhere Cron is being lead through the plains by a mysterious crackling voice on the edge of his perception.

Mabyn sees him in the distance and the party meet Cron. Mabyn is not impressed. Kona chats his ear off as they continue on their way and up an incline. At the top, they stop as Kona’s sword rumbles.

From behind the rocks is this large two headed creature - not nearly as big as Fegan described. The creature threatens to take their stuff.

FIGHT!

Taban tries to climb a cliff and take the giant by surprise. The giant sees him and tries to take a swing but misses.

The wolf attacks Kona.

Fallon does something magical that I missed.

Cron casts detect magic. He detects something on Taban, and a bit here and there, but nothing on the enemies.

Kona rages. Her armor glows green.

Mabyn runs up the incline and casts entangle at the giant. Vines climb up from the ground and twist their way around the creature’s limbs, but it breaks free.

Taban backs away from the incline and the creature turns towards Kona and takes two swings. The first swing misses, but the second strikes. The wolf lunges again at Kona and bites her leg.

Fallon does some more magic. Sorry. I don’t know what you are doing ever. :-(

Cron also does something magic.

Kona swings at the wolf and takes its head clear off. It crashes into the rocks behind her.

Mabyn launches a fireball that misses the giant and she runs towards some rocks to possible use for cover.

Taban sees a second wolf coming from along the ledge. He runs towards it and swings but misses.

The giant swings wildly at the air.

The wolf takes a snap at Taban, but he moves himself out of the way.

Fallon casts thunderbolt.

Cron, does something.

Kona attacks the giant with a grand blow of her sword.

Mabyn misses horribly with her fireball attack and curse wildly in her native tongue.

Taban kicks the wolf so hard it yelps in pain. He uses his bare hands to strike the wolf in the neck killing it. He scales the cliff face and turns his attention to the giant.

The giant pokes the air and rants about magic messing with his mind. He turns back towards Kona.

Fallon does magic.

Cron does magic.

Kona, in her rage, swings her sword and hits giant who takes a massive blow.

Mabyn finally hits the giant with her fireball which smolders and dies out.

Taban acrobatics his way over the rocks and through the vines to land a hit on the giant.

The giant starts to run away but Kona and Taban attack as he flees. Taban hits the giant on the ankle bringing him down and them plunges his sword into his skull.

Investigating the body, they find 15 silver. Kona takes the wolf head to turn into a hat.

Mabyn uses wild shape to turn into a wolf and sniff out their lair south east of here.

The party finds a small lean to outside a cave with the three camels sitting outside the cave. As we walk in we see one side has soft bedding with chewed up bones and a bunch of rugs and blankets piled up on the other side.

A chest in the back of the cave container three bottles, two light pink, one dark pink, and two rolled up pieces of parchment - one is an illusion spell and one is a divination spell. The potions are evocation. (Disguise Self and locate object) (2 reg healing and 1 greater healing)

The party spends the night in the cave - Kona failing miserably at the hat. They pack up the camels with the rugs and supplies and continues on their way.

Based on what Fegan told them, they believe they are about two nights out from Koram. As the party gets closer, the gates of Koram rise up ahead of us.

The party goes to the halfing encampment. Matron Vadoma comes to great them. She goes to Mabyn and thanks her for returning the children. Mabyn tells the matron that they need to talk about Annachaul.

They go to her tent and Fallon lays out her theory that the child is possessed by a ????? She pulls a small box out with four gems in it. She tells the party they should be worth about 200 gold. Fallon tries to refuse the money but Madame Vadoma tells her that a debt must be paid.

After they leave, Mabyn tells Madame Vadoma that she should continue with the group to try and find a cure for whatever is wrong with Annachaul.

The party sells the gems, divides the loot, and Kona give a rug to the orphanage.
