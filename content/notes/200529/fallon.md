some of the spine, killing the lich

at Kona

On the Lich, a ring: (transmutation)

Three coffins in the back room, labeled Haran, Jula and Kira
We put Haran back to rest, and leave flowers and coins for their rest

Go upstairs, investigate a young woman's room. There's a cockatrice, chained to
the bed. Leave it for now.

Go upstairs. The library has rotted, useless books. Map carved on the table:
Korum and East Rodhan. Skeletal remains of a human skewered to the table by a
long, spiny sword.

Goblin: Grudu

Head back to town.
